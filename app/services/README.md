# ðŸ§  Services (Business Logic)

This is where the "thinking" happens.

-   **What goes here?** The complex business logic of your application. If an API endpoint needs to do something more than just reading or writing from the database, the logic for it goes here.
-   **Think of it like:** The chef in a kitchen. The API endpoint takes the order, but the service layer (the chef) knows how to actually cook the meal.
