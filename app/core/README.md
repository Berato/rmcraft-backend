# ⚙️ Core Logic

This is the heart of your application's configuration.

-   **What goes here?**
    -   App settings (like from environment variables).
    -   Middleware (code that runs with every request).
    -   Things that need to be set up once when the app starts.
-   **Think of it like:** The engine room of a ship. It controls the important stuff that keeps everything running smoothly.
