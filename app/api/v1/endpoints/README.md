# ðŸš¦ API Endpoints

This is where your API routes live!

-   **What goes here?** Each file in this directory should represent a set of related API endpoints (e.g., `users.py`, `products.py`).
-   **Think of it like:** The different stops on a subway line. Each stop (`/users`, `/products`) lets you do different things.

**Example:** A `/health` endpoint to check if the app is running.
