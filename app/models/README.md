# ðŸ§± Models (Database Tables)

This is where you define what your database tables look like.

-   **What goes here?** Classes that map to your database tables (e.g., using SQLAlchemy or another ORM).
-   **Think of it like:** The design of a spreadsheet. Each model defines the columns and data types for a table.

**Example:** A `User` model with `id`, `username`, and `hashed_password` columns.
