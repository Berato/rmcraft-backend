# 📝 Schemas (Pydantic Models)

This is where you define the "shape" of your data.

-   **What goes here?** Pydantic models that validate incoming request data and format outgoing response data.
-   **Think of it like:** A blueprint for your data. It makes sure everything is in the right format, so you don't get surprises.

**Example:** A `UserCreate` schema that requires a `username` and `email`.
