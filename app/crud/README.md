# 🛠️ CRUD Operations

CRUD stands for **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete.

-   **What goes here?** Reusable functions for basic database operations.
-   **Think of it like:** A set of basic tools. Instead of building a new hammer every time you need one, you just grab the one from your toolbox.

**Example:** `get_user_by_email`, `create_item`.
